# MilaMade Macramê Website

Welcome to the MilaMade Macramê website project! This project is part of the Codecademy Front-End Devolopment course, where I'm exploring and applying the properties of CSS Flexbox to create a web page for a fictional company, MilaMade.

## Project Overview

MilaMade is a fictional company focused on the art of Macramê. The website is a work in progress and aims to showcase the beauty of Macramê, provide information about the company, and offer products related to this craft.

## Project Structure

### HTML
- The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the basic structure of the MilaMade website.
- Sections include a header, main content, and a footer.
- The main content is divided into sections such as mission, store, and team, each with relevant information.

### CSS
- The CSS file (`milamade.css`) will be used to style the website and implement the Flexbox layout.
- Fonts from Google Fonts are linked to enhance the visual appeal of the website.

## Current Progress

- The basic structure of the website is in place.
- Content is categorized into sections, including the mission, store, and team.
